# Buffered Input/Output

## Making Copies

- PIP (disk#):(new file's name)=(old file name) creates a copy of old file on a given disk

## Using DDT

- DDT is CP/M's Dynamic Debugging Tool

- Portions of code can be run and then register contents and memory contents checked

|Command Character|	Result                                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|A	              |enters assembly-language mnemonics with operands.|
|D	              |displays memory in hexadecimal and ASCII.        |
|F	              |fills memory with constant data.                 |
|G	              |begins execution with optional breakpoints.      |
|I	              |sets up a standard input File Control Block.     |
|L	              |lists memory using assembler mnemonics.          |
|M	              |moves a memory segment from source to destination.|
|R	              |reads a program for subsequent testing.          |
|S	              |substitutes memory values.                       |
|T	              |traces program execution.                        |
|U	              |untraced program monitoring.                     |
|X	              |examines and optionally alters the CPU state.    |
